MSDS Degree Capstone Project Model - Logistic model of credit scoring

## Overview 
This contains the final report and code used to generate data analysis in R.  That includes feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and a comparison of different models.  There is also a performance monitoring plan and simulated monitoring results.

## Data
The data is taken from *default of credit card clients Data Set* on the UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

## Processing
Reports for the model generation phase and validation plan/validation are included, as well as R code used to analyze data and prepare the models.

Please refer to the papers for explanation and interpretation.  There are some notes in the R file, but minimal.  The R code takes days to run so I don't have time to knit it all together at the moment.
